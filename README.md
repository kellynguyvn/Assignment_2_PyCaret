After Analyzing the data the program was able to create and apply models. I thought this was very neat although it took a while for the site to do the analysis since the dataset was quite large.

## Part 2: Pycaret
### Goals
<br />
The goal for this part of the assignment was to Do varios ML Task using pycaret. For some of the tasks I inputted datasets from Kaggle in order to attempt Classification, Regression, Clustering, Anomaly Detection, Association Rules Mining, and Time Series Forecasting (Univariate without Exogenous Variables/ Univariate with Exogenous Variables)
<br />
